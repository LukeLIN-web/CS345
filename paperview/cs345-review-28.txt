==+== B. Paper summary

Existing kernel-bypass networking needs to dedicate enough cores for the peak expected load. Shenango achieves comparable latencies but at far greater CPU efficiency. It reallocates cores across applications at very fine granularity—enabling cycles unused by latency-sensitive applications to be used productively by batch processing applications. It can linearly trade latency-sensitive application throughput for batch processing application throughput, increasing CPU efficiency.


==+== C. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.


1. propose an algorithm that detects when applications would benefit from more cores.
2. Introduce IOKernel to steer packets from the NIC and orchestrate core reallocations. 


==+== D. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences,
==-==    please.

1. It couple a heavy bruden to IOKernel, it is not easy for future improvement.
2. At the very low service times of memcached (< 2 μs), the IOKernel becomes a bottleneck.

==+== E. Detailed comments

Strengths
1. IOKernel has its own core and root privileges. It can check thread and packet queue and reallocate cores efficiently.
2. This paper finds the duration of queuing is a more robust signal than the length of a queue. So the congestion detection algorithm uses this signal to determines whether a runtime is overloaded or not.
3. Shenango incurs almost no additional tail latency even when handling an extreme load shift from 100,000 to 5 million requests per second.
