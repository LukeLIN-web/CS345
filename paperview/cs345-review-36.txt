==+== B. Paper summary

Parallel training has memory redundancy problems. ZeRO can reduce memory consumption to train larger models. It split model states. This paper train Turing-NLG, the largest language model at the time (17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.



==+== C. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.

1. It is the basis of DeepSpeed 


==+== D. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences,
==-==    please.



==+== E. Detailed comments

Methods
1. For model states, such as adam states, this paper use partition to save model state in each GPU. 
2. For buffer, this paper create a fixed buffer, bucket multiple group of small data.
3. It also parition gradient on each GPUs.
