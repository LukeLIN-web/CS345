==+== B. Paper summary


large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. This paper proposes a intra-layer tensor parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters.



==+== C. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.

1. It can train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model to achieve SOTA results.
2. It achieves 76% scaling efficiency with 512 GPUs.




==+== D. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences,
==-==    please.

1. Training a model with more than 16 billion parameters will demand more memory than is available within 16 GPUs of a DGX-2H box. The ZeRO paper solves this problem.


==+== E. Detailed comments

Strengths
1. Before this paper, tensor parallel requires new frameworks or copmilers. This paper don't require any new compiler.
2. This paper splits A along its columns can remove a synchronization point. Similarly, it splits K,Q,V in a column parallel fashion.
3. NSDI'24, Bytedance use 10000 GPUs, MegaScale is built on top of Megatron-LM. proves its success in future.

Weaknesses
1. The input and output (B, S, H) of each model block need to be repeatedly stored multiple times.
