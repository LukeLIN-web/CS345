==+== B. Paper summary

This paper designs streaming instead of fix-size packet buffers IO interface. It can reduce metadata, buffer copy and data concat overhead. Enso can saturate a 100Gbps link with minimum-sized packets using a single core.



==+== C. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.

1. Enso frees the NIC and application to use arbitrary data formats. 
2. Enso reduces PCIe bandwidth overhead due to metadata.
3. It enables better use of the CPU prefetcher to mask memory latency, thus further improving performance.

==+== D. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences,
==-==    please.



==+== E. Detailed comments

Strengths
1. Enso reduces PCIe bandwidth overhead due to metadata, because it is able to aggregate notifications for multiple chunks of data written to the same buffer.
2. Enso message buffer is opaque, so it is more general for upper layer application.




It has well written artifact. It has detailed setup introduction, installation and test cases. Therefore, it also obtained distinguished artiface award. The authors implement smartNIC in FPGA, so other researchers don't need specfic hardware to reproduce the results. (Mainwhile it requires FPGA knowledge)
