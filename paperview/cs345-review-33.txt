==+== B. Paper summary

DNN training energy consumption is skyrocketing. However, existing efforts are not practical enough. This paper proposes Zeus, an optimization framework to find the optimal job and GPU-level configurations automatically. Zeus profiles energy characteristics and uses Multi-Armed Bandit to explore the cost of different batch sizes. Zeus can improve the energy efficiency of DNN training by 15.3%–75.8%.


==+== C. Strengths
==-==    What are the paper’s strengths? Just a couple sentences, please.

1. It uses mature solutions like multi-armed bandit to solve a less-focused problem. It is easy to follow and improve.
2. we can learn how to optimize some metrics(speed/energy) across retraining jobs. 
3. Zeus is pretty flexible. It can deal with different DNN jobs, handle workloads with data drift, and scale to multi-GPU settings.

==+== D. Weaknesses
==-==    What are the paper’s weaknesses? Just a couple sentences,
==-==    please.

1. It still takes more time in some cases. Energy is not the most important thing. We mostly pay attention to the training time. 
2. It simplifies the case. It uses at most four NVIDIA A40 GPUs. In a real scenario, only a large GPU cluster would consume a lot of energy. The A40 GPU is commonly used for inference, not training.

==+== E. Detailed comments

Strengths
1. Zeus is easy to use. Zeus is implemented as a Python library that can be imported into DNN training scripts. 
2. While Zeus and Grid Search perform close to each other, Zeus uses significantly smaller amount of resources to converge.


Weaknesses
1. It doesn't evaluate in clusters. In cluster training, the batch size selection is different from the setting in the paper. And it doesn't consider different parallel training, which are commonly used in real training scenarios. The envpipe paper(ATC'23) notices parallel training and gives an inspiring solution.
